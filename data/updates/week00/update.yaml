Who is our customer or customers?
  * Millennials
  * Students in college 
  * Students just out of college
  * Middle-aged people in a full-time job with or without children
  * Middle schools
  
What is their *pain*?
  * Time constraint to perform community service (to do research etc.)
  * Lack of knowledge 
  * Not a lot of options
  
What kind of software do you think will solve their pain?
  * Taking the geolocation and schedule of each user and compiling a list of options for them
  * Being to see reviews from previous volunteers 

How do you know these things?
  * Personal experience of wanting to do service but being unable to find the time to research  

How will you reach these customers and convert them into users of your app?
  * College community organizations
  * Service blogs
  * Facebook groups 
  * Middle school groups 

Could this potentially be used by millions of people? Why do you think so?
 * **Yes**! Think of Yelp, but for volunteer organizations.
 > “Recent studies in psychology showed that the pursuit of self-interest may not be the clearest 
 >  path to the greater good or personal happiness.”

 * In other words, people are realizing that service and selflessness is a component to happiness
 * Our theory is that the main thing stopping people from doing service work is convenience 

How do you imagine that you would support this venture? Is it non-profit? Is it for profit?

It is a for-profit venture. We plan on charging a small monthly fee, a minimum amount of $1.99 for 
supporting the app. If they pay anything above $1.99, the balance will go to an organization of the month. 

What are the biggest risks? 
  * Lack of operating costs
  * Premature scale, growing too fast
  * People aren’t willing to pay (the app does not solve the problem/this is not even a problem)
  * Even with the app people are not going to volunteer
  * The team didnt have the right knowledge base to build the startup correctly 

Now that you know the biggest risks, how could you most swiftly allay your fears about them? 
  * By faking the app to test theories out – will customers be willing to pay, do you volunteer, 
   if you don’t volunteer, why? Would this app increase your likeliness to volunteer? 
  * We have google and Kyle and TAs and magic 

How can we maximize impact and what do we need to build?
  * Getting as many organizations and users registered
  * Push notifications are an annoying blessing
  * Implementation in public schools - make this an app teachers use

How will software function?
* Log in, provide details (location, schedule)
* A menu with categories to tell you what kind of service is available near you tailored to your schedule

Describe the application architecture and technical choices needed to build that software. 
> How is it divided between client and server? 
  * NO CLUE
  
> How do they communicate? 
  * NO CLUE
  
> How are you storing data? 
  * SQL
  
> How will you manage, test, and deploy your code?
  * NO CLUE 
  
> What technology stack are you going to use?
  * Git hub is god, Git hub is life
  
> How is our software designed? How do the pieces fit together?
  * TO COMPLETE -- Give a high level review of the SQL table

> I awoke and saw that life was service. 
> I acted and behold, service was joy.” *
